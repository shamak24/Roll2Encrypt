Ludo-Based Data Encryption System

Problem Statement

Traditional encryption methods rely on mathematical transformations that, while secure, are often susceptible to brute-force attacks with increasing computational power. A novel approach to encryption is needed—one that integrates game mechanics to obfuscate data in a way that is difficult to predict or crack using conventional decryption methods.

Why Is This Important?
		1.	Security Through Obfuscation: Unlike standard encryption techniques (AES, RSA), this method makes pattern recognition and decryption harder by using the game mechanics of Ludo to encrypt data.
		2.	Novelty & Innovation: Most encryption methods use direct mathematical transformations, whereas this method maps data to real-world gameplay movements, making it unconventional and unpredictable.
		3.	Educational Value: It provides an interactive way to understand encryption, making it useful for educational purposes and cryptographic research.
		4.	Potential Real-World Use Cases:
			•	Secure Messaging Systems (hiding encryption in game data).
			•	Steganography (concealing messages within gameplay).
			•	Gaming Industry Security (for securing in-game transactions).

Significance of the Project
	•	Introduces game-based cryptography, an innovative way to secure data.
	•	Uses Huffman coding to compress and encode text efficiently.
	•	Incorporates multiple game parameters (Ludo pieces, board positions, dice values) for encryption.
	•	Provides an extra layer of randomness, making brute-force decryption much harder.

Technologies Used

 	Programming Language: Python
	Data Structures:
		•	Huffman Tree (for character encoding).
		•	Hash Tables (for fast lookup of dice mappings).
		•	Graph (for board representation).
	Randomization: PRNG (Pseudo-Random Number Generator) for dice rolls.
	File Handling: To store encrypted messages and metadata.

Solution Statement

This encryption system will convert text into an encoded format using a combination of Huffman coding and Ludo game mechanics. Each ASCII character will be mapped to a game action, which consists of:
	•	Which color piece moves (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow).
	•	Which type of piece was moved (capital letter, lowercase, number, symbol).
	•	Which square the piece moved to (based on Ludo board positions).
	•	What was the dice roll value (ranging from 1-99).

Each of these parameters contributes to the final Huffman-encoded bit sequence, which is stored as the encrypted output.

How It Works (Encryption Process)

	Step 1: Text Input & ASCII Conversion
		1.	The user inputs a text message for encryption.
		2.	Each character is converted into ASCII format.

	Step 2: Apply Huffman Coding
		3.	A Huffman tree is built based on character frequency.
		4.	Each character is assigned a unique binary Huffman code (variable-length).

	Step 3: Map Huffman Codes to Ludo Game Elements
		5.	Each character’s Huffman code is used to determine:
			•	Color of the Ludo piece moving
			•	Type of character (capital, small, number, symbol) → Which piece moves
			•	Board square number (based on a predefined mapping).
			•	Dice value assigned to that move (randomized but reversible).

	Step 4: Generate the Encrypted Output
		6.	The final encrypted message consists of a sequence of Ludo movements, each representing a character in the original text.
		7.	This sequence is stored or transmitted securely.
